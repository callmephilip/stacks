# SoundCloud Dev Challenge

'Stacks' is a SoundCloud based playlist manager. Live demo is [here](http://callmephilip.github.com/stacks/). 

## Note to SoundClouders

I have been continuing to work on Stacks after submitting the challenge:
* polishing things here and there
* bookmarklet feature

## Note to CS majors

Most playlists are technically FIFO queues (as oppposed to LIFO stacks). Project name refers to a less geeky meaning of the term

```
stack noun \Ëˆstak\

- an orderly pile or heap
- a large quantity or number
```
